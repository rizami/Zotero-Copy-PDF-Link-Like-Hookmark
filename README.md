# Copy PDF Link
A translator .js file to copy PDF link in Zotero similar to Hookmark (runs on macOS, not sure about other OS).

## Motivation
Use the zotero link so that you don't need to worry about the file location, just copy the link to PDF, paste in the browser, document, spreadsheet, presentation etc as hyperlink, and it will open the PDF file for you. :)

## How to use it
1. Put the .js file in the `translators` folder of Zotero software
2. Restart Zotero
3. In the "Settings..." of Zotero, under Export tab and 'Item Format:' dropdown menu, change the `Export Formats` to `Copy PDF Link`
4. Point and select the PDF file you want to create link (this is important, otherwise the link created will not open the PDF file)
5. Under Edit dropdown menu, select 'Copy as Copy PDF Link' or use keyboard short `Cmd+Shift+C` to copy PDF link and it will generate link like this: 'zotero://open-pdf/0_LBXHZKH7'
