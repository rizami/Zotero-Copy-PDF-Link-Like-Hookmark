# Copy PDF Link
A translator .js file to copy PDF link in Zotero similar to Hookmark (runs on macOS, not sure about other OS).

## Motivation
Use the Zotero link to avoid concerns about the file location; simply copy the PDF link and paste it as a hyperlink in your browser, document, spreadsheet, presentation, etc. Clicking on the hyperlink will open the PDF file for you.

## How to use it
1. Place the .js file in the translators folder of the Zotero software.
2. Restart Zotero.
3. In the "Settings..." of Zotero, under the Export tab and within the 'Item Format:' dropdown menu, change the Export Formats to Copy PDF Link.
4. Select the PDF file for which you wish to create a link (this is important; otherwise, the link created will not open the PDF file).
5. From the Edit dropdown menu, choose 'Copy as Copy PDF Link' or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd+Shift+C to copy the PDF link, which will generate a link similar to this: 'zotero://open-pdf/0_LBXHZKH7'.
